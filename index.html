    <h1>
      Animosity Towards Cats
    </h1>
    <h3>
      From @officialstevenwalker
    </h3>
    <p> Got a question for you: <em> why </em> is there so much <b>animosity</b> towards cats?</p>
    <p> I mean, they get more hate than the newest <em>Nickelback</em> album! </p>
    <p> They get more criticism than <em>I</em> didâ€”that time I worked a booth at a <em>bizarre</em> state fair.</p>
    <p>
      Why? What has a cat ever done to you,<br>
      other than <strong>not relying on you for its very existence?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      You can't say that about a dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dog <em>needs</em> you: for shelter, for love, and food. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, I don't see my cat <b>for weeks at a time!</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Our relationship could be best described as an <em>agreement</em>, and I haven't <strong>bought cat food in 12 years></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
       Somehow, she's <em>thriving.</em> 
    </p>
